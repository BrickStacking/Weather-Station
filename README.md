# Weather-Station
That project I use to get weather data from the meteorological station to Esp32. Then display on the TFT screen.  

To make this project, you guys need somethings like

-TFT Screen display, how to use it, I make that video(https://youtu.be/rZ_qOQNCRx8)

-Esp32

-Sd card module (use SD card to expand memory and save image, icon weather)

Inside is full code and Altium File. Hope you guys love it. And give me a star :D 

Note: The line chart of temperature isn't finish. Complete it for me :3
